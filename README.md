This small project showcases my understanding of the DOM
under javascript.

In this project I demonstatrate the knowledge of how
to SELECT and MANIPULATE elements from the DOM.

document.querySelector, element.selectElementsByX, 
.textContent, .innerHTML and other selectors and manipulators were used.

Lol...just getting round this stuff.

I am really learning fast.

Thanks for reading my README...
